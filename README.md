Data poisoning is a critical security concern in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Malicious actors intentionally inject manipulated or misleading data into training sets with the aim of compromising model performance. This project presents an overview of data poisoning, delving into its mechanisms, impact, and detection methods. It highlights the potential vulnerabilities of AI algorithms to data poisoning attacks and emphasizes the need for robust defense strategies. It also discusses resilient algorithms that demonstrate resistance to data poisoning, shedding light on their design principles and inherent strengths. The primary objective of this research project is to improve model resilience and accuracy in machine learning by addressing data poisoning attacks. These attacks involve injecting malicious data into the training dataset, compromising model performance and security. To tackle this, a multi-faceted approach is proposed, including data assessment and cleaning, detection of attacks using outlier and anomaly detection, robust model training using techniques like adversarial training, regularization, and data diversification, ensemble methods combining the strengths of multiple models, and Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization for enhanced robustness against attacks. This comprehensive framework for addressing data poisoning attacks aims to enhance the security and reliability of machine learning systems. Through rigorous experimentation, evaluation, and documentation, this project offers practical solutions to the growing threat of data poisoning attacks. Its real-world impact extends across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles, and contributes to building trust in machine learning systems. By addressing a global concern and advancing the understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses in the machine learning community, this research has the potential to influence ML practices worldwide, making AI technologies safer for all.
